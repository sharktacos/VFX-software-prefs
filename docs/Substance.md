Watch a <a href="https://vimeo.com/469364354">video walkthrough</a> of the tools and how they are used to optimze your workflow.

UPDATE: The *Blending Mask* used to export masks has been depreciated. Instead you can export masks by right-clicking the mask and choosing "export mask to file" in the context menu. As of version 7.2 this also works for UDIMs.
