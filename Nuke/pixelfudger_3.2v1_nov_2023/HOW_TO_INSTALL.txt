	A File manager (i.e. Nautilus) window should appear and show the contents of your $HOME/.nuke folder.


2- Copy the pixelfudger3 directory into your $HOME/.nuke directory.
    - You may want to rename your previous pixelfudger3 directory to something like pixelfudger3_bak
      before copying if you want to keep it in case of new bugs.

3a- If you DO NOT have an init.py file in your $HOME/.nuke directory already:
    - Copy the provided init.py to your $HOME/.nuke directory.
    - Relaunch Nuke and enjoy your new tools!


3b- IF you DO have an init.py file currently in your $HOME/.nuke directory:
    - Edit your init.py in a text editor
    - Add the following lines to it:

       import nuke
       nuke.pluginAddPath('pixelfudger3')


4- If you had a previous Pixelfudger installation:
  - Remove "nuke.pluginAddPath('pixelfudger')" from your init.py
  - Remove "import pixelfudger" from your menu.py
  - Remove the old "pixelfudger" directory from your $HOME/.nuke directory.
  - Pixelfudger3 doesn't require an 'import' command in your menu.py anymore
    just the nuke.pluginAddPath('pixelfudger3') line in your init.py.

5- Relaunch Nuke and enjoy your new tools!
